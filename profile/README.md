## Step-by-Step Recipe for Ragi Roti

### Step 1: Mix the Flours  
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of ragi flour and ¾ cup of rice flour. Add ½ teaspoon of salt and mix thoroughly.  

### Step 2: Add Oil  
Add 1 teaspoon of oil to the flour mixture and mix well. This step ensures the rotis are soft and easy to roll.  

### Step 3: Prepare the Dough  
Gradually pour hot water into the mixture while stirring with a spatula. Once it cools enough to handle, knead into a smooth, soft dough. If it feels sticky, dust with more rice or ragi flour. Cover and let it rest for 10 minutes.  

### Step 4: Divide and Shape  
Divide the dough into small portions, roll each into a ball, and flatten. Lightly dust your surface with flour, and roll into a circle.  

### Step 5: Cook the Rotis  
Heat a tawa (flat pan) over medium heat. Place the roti on the hot tawa and cook each side for 1-2 minutes until light brown spots appear. Add a small amount of ghee for enhanced flavor.  

### Step 6: Serve and Enjoy  
Serve hot with tomato thokku, chutney, or any curry of your choice.
